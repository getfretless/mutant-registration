# Mutant Registration

This handy Rails app makes it easy to stay compliant with the Mutant Registration Act.

It's a simple scaffolded app, written for the [Ruby on Rails course at Eleven Fifty](https://elevenfifty.com/course/ruby-on-rails/) by [Fretless](https://github.com/getfretless).

Build it yourself:

```shell
$ rails new mutant-registration
$ cd mutant-registration
$ bin/rails g scaffold mutant name:string power:string age:integer real_name:string
```
